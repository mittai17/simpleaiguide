# ⭐ 2.5 Why Machine Learning Works (Clear Explanation)

![Why ML Works](/images/learn/machine-learning/module-2/image-5.png)

ML works because the world contains patterns.

### Examples:

-   People who buy **baby diapers** also buy **baby wipes**
-   Customers who watch **action movies** also like **thrillers**
-   Spam emails share certain phrases
-   Fraud transactions have unusual patterns

Humans cannot identify millions of such patterns manually — ML can.

### Machine Learning’s strength:

-   Detect patterns
-   Make accurate predictions
-   Automate decisions
-   Learn from new information
