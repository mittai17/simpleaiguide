Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

## Core idea

We give the model data and labels, and it learns a mapping from inputs to outputs.

## Common ML tasks

- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
