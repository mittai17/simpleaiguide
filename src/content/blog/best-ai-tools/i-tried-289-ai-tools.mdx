## Quick Summary: Top AI Money-Makers

| Tool | Best For | Business Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **[CreateUGC](https://www.createugc.ai/)** | Video Ads | Affiliate Marketing / TikTok Shop |

## Why These AI Tools Stand Out for Making Money

If you want to make money with AI, the smartest play right now is simple:

**Take a proven business model, then plug [Machine Learning](/learn/machine-learning/module-2/2-1-what-is-ml) and AI into it to move faster and cheaper.**

That is why the tools here focus on:

*   Ecommerce stores that run almost on autopilot
*   UGC-style videos that send traffic to your offers
*   AI-generated music and sound effects you can sell or use in content
*   High-quality images and videos without a studio or editor
*   Chatbots that pull from the best models instead of locking you into one
*   Simple and advanced app builders
*   Voice cloning, second-brain note systems, and idea brainstorming

You might have even searched something odd like `best-ai ai` when trying to find tools that actually help you earn. This list is built exactly for that person: someone who wants results, not just “try this shiny tool” fluff.

Use this as a menu, not a rigid checklist. Start with the area that matches how you already like to work: selling products, creating content, building apps, or doing client work.

## Build a Full Ecommerce Store in Minutes with AI

![AI Ecommerce Store Dashboard](/blog/ai-ecommerce-store.webp)

### Why Ecommerce + AI Is Such a Strong Combo

Ecommerce is a proven model. People have been buying physical products online for decades. That means you are not guessing whether the model works, you are only improving how you run it.

AI now removes a bunch of traditional barriers:

*   You no longer need to design a store from scratch
*   You do not need to understand Shopify themes or apps
*   You do not need to manually connect fulfillment

In the video, there is a live pet-product Shopify store where people can browse and buy, and the wild part is that it was created 100% by AI. Products, design, setup, and even order fulfillment were all handled automatically.

### How to Use BuildYourStore.ai to Launch a Store Fast

The tool behind that store is [Build Your Store](https://www.buildyourstore.ai/0850), and at the time of recording, it can be used completely free through a special link.

Here is how it works in plain English:

1.  Go to the Build Your Store signup page and hit “Build my free store”.
2.  Create a free account.
3.  Answer a few guided questions:
    *   What niche do you want? (pets, electronics, fashion, etc.)
    *   What kind of look and feel do you like?
4.  Let the AI go to work while it builds your Shopify store.

At the end, you get:

*   A clean, ready-to-use Shopify store
*   Products loaded into the store
*   The back end wired for automatic fulfillment and shipping

The key benefit is you skip weeks of tinkering and go straight to testing products and marketing. This matches what many ecommerce pros recommend, like the idea of using AI builders to speed up launch time that you will also see in long-form breakdowns such as the guide on [AI ecommerce website builder tools](https://www.smartosc.com/top-10-ai-ecommerce-website-builder-tools/).

If you are looking for the fastest way to plug AI into a real business model, starting with an AI-built store like this is one of the clearest options.

## Drive Traffic with AI-Generated UGC Videos

A store without traffic is a ghost town. After you have a shop online, the next question is simple: how do you get people to actually visit and buy?

### What UGC Is and Why It Sells So Well

UGC stands for user-generated content. Think of TikTok or Instagram videos where a person talks directly to the camera:

> “I love this gym bag, it fits everything, it is water-resistant, and here is where you can get it.”

These videos do so well because they feel like real recommendations, not polished ads. Now AI can act as that “user,” so you do not have to pay influencers or show your own face.

Instead, you create an AI influencer that looks and talks like a real person and have them feature your product.

### How to Create UGC-Style Videos with CreateUGC

The tool used in the example is [CreateUGC](https://www.createugc.ai/). It turns a product page into a short, realistic vertical video.

The flow is simple:

1.  Log in and click “New Video”.
2.  Paste your product URL, such as a specific Amazon product page.
3.  Choose the video type:
    *   Reaction video
    *   Product-in-hand
    *   Product-in-hand V3 (higher quality)
4.  The AI pulls in:
    *   Product title
    *   Description
    *   All available images
5.  Pick the main image you want shown in the video.
6.  Choose:
    *   Aspect ratio (like 9:16 for TikTok/Reels)
    *   Video length
    *   Your AI “influencer” from the library of human-style presenters
7.  Choose a script:
    *   Pick from 3 AI-generated scripts, or
    *   Write your own custom pitch
8.  Hit generate and wait a short time.

The result in the demo was wild. The AI model held a gym bag or water bottle as if it were real, pointed to details, and even had water moving inside the bottle. The background was clean, the lighting looked natural, and the script sounded like a normal social video.

This kind of content is perfect for:

*   TikTok Spark Ads
*   Reels and Shorts ads
*   Organic posts to warm up audiences before they click to your store

When you stack an AI-built store with AI UGC that runs 24/7 on social, you start to see how AI can open up multiple income streams without needing a giant team.

## Create and Sell AI Music & Sound Effects with 11Labs

Most people know [11Labs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/paul) for its voice cloning and text-to-speech, but it can also generate full songs and sound effects you can use commercially, depending on your plan.

Before using AI music commercially, always review the latest terms and laws in your country. Things are changing fast in this area, so treat this like any other rights issue and stay updated. For general context on how creators use music and audio in online businesses, you might also like the broader view from Shopify’s guide on [AI tools for ecommerce businesses](https://www.shopify.com/blog/ai-tools-for-ecommerce).

### How to Generate Songs with 11Labs

Inside 11Labs, head to the music section. The interface is prompt-based, just like a chatbot.

For example:

1.  In the prompt box, type something like:
    “Easy lo-fi study music with a nice beat.”
2.  Set your options:
    *   Variations: start with 1 (more is usually not needed)
    *   Length: pick something like 30 seconds while testing
    *   Lyrics:
        *   Instrumental (no vocals)
        *   Custom lyrics
        *   Auto-generated lyrics
3.  Check how many credits it will use.
4.  Click “Generate” and watch it build your track.

The tool breaks the song into sections:

*   Intro
*   Main beat
*   Outro

You can see which styles it included and which it excluded. If the track is too slow or too chill, you can change the styles and regenerate.

**Example tweaks:**

*   Remove “easy listening,” “mellow,” and “relaxing” from included styles
*   Remove “fast tempo” from excluded styles
*   Add notes like “more upbeat” or “more energetic drop”
*   Generate a new version of the same idea

You can also create a track like:

> “House music with a great drop.”

Then turn on lyrics, pick auto-lyrics, and let it write and sing them for you. You can even mark sections for regeneration, change a verse, or switch the style of just the drop.

### Sound Effects and Pricing

11Labs also includes a sound effects generator. You type a description and it produces multiple variations. Examples shown:

*   Dog barking in different tones
*   Camera shutter
*   Beach ambiance
*   Cinematic logo reveal

If you create YouTube videos, short-form content, or client content, this can save a ton of time hunting through stock libraries.

**Pricing highlights at the time of recording:**

*   **Free plan:**
    *   10,000 monthly credits
    *   You can use music commercially, but you must attribute 11Labs and follow their rules
*   **Starter plan (popular):**
    *   Around $5 per month
    *   30,000 credits
    *   Better option if you plan to use AI music and voices in your business long term

For anyone doing content-heavy businesses, this one tool can handle voiceovers, background tracks, and custom sound effects.

## All-in-One AI Images and Video Creation with Pollo AI

If you work with thumbnails, short videos, ads, or creative assets, you normally have to jump between a lot of different apps. [Pollo AI](https://pollo.ai?ref=zgq2ymy) fixes that by bringing many of the strongest image and video models together under one roof.

### Why a Multi-Model Platform Matters

Instead of only using Gemini or a single image model, Pollo AI gives you access to multiple top options in one interface. For video, you can choose models like:

*   Google Veo 3.1
*   Sora 2
*   Other high-end video models as they are released

You can switch between them, compare results, and choose the best output for each project.

### Key Features Inside Pollo AI

Here are some of the tools available:

*   **Text-to-video and image-to-video:** Type a description or upload an image, then turn it into a video.
*   **AI lip sync:** Match a face to an audio track.
*   **Image and video enhancers:** Upscale, sharpen, restore old photos, and clean up low-resolution clips.
*   **Subtitle remover:** Remove burned-in subtitles from videos.
*   **Consistent characters and avatars:** Keep the same character across multiple images or videos.
*   **AI shorts:** Quickly generate vertical videos from prompts or media.

One standout tool is **Mimic**. You upload a video of someone walking, dancing, or doing some movement. Then you upload a photo of yourself, and the AI replaces the original person in the video with you. This opens up fun content ideas, fan edits, and even client offers.

Pollo AI also has “effects” templates that create trendy viral looks. Examples:

*   Upload a selfie and get a dramatic zoom-out shot that ends with the whole Earth in the frame.
*   Upload a photo of two people and generate a hugging animation.

For images, it supports text-to-image, image-to-image, and effects using leading models, including new releases like Google’s Nano Banana Pro. That means you can use one dashboard to handle thumbnails, product images, reels, and experimentation.

## Switch AI Models Easily For Better Results with i10X

When people think “AI chatbot,” they often think of a single tool like ChatGPT. The problem is that no single model is the best at everything.

[i10X](https://i10x.ai?fpr=paul53) solves that by giving you access to many major models in one place, then letting you test them side by side.

### Chat Arena: Put Models Head to Head

Inside i10X you get a normal chat interface, but the real magic is in the Chat Arena.

Here is how it works:

1.  Choose one model on the left, for example GPT-5.
2.  Choose another on the right, such as Claude 4.5 Sonnet.
3.  Paste the same prompt into both sides.

In the video example, the prompt was something like:

> “Reply to this email from an angry customer.”

Both models produced strong responses, but Claude’s reply felt a bit more human and empathetic. That means next time you are dealing with sensitive customer emails, you already know which model to pick.

Beyond the arena, i10X also offers:

*   AI image generation using models like Google’s latest image tools
*   Deep research powered by Perplexity Sonar Pro
*   Chat with PDFs and other documents
*   Simple AI video tools
*   Custom agents you can set up for repeat tasks

If you are serious about using the `best-ai ai` tools for different jobs, an aggregator like this gives you more control and better outputs than locking into one platform.

## Build Complete Apps With AI (No Code and Pro Options)

You can also use AI to build full apps, either for your own business or as a service you sell to others.

There are two great free options from Google: one simple, one more advanced.

### Beginner-Friendly: Opal by Google

[Opal](https://opal.google) has a clean, minimal dashboard and lets you describe the app you want in plain English.

Example from the video:

1.  Click “Create new”.
2.  Type: “Create a task tracking app for kids.”
3.  Hit submit and wait a short moment.

Opal then builds a working app. In this case, you could:

*   Enter tasks like “brush teeth,” “clean room,” and “feed cat.”
*   See a checklist appear that kids can mark off.

You can share the finished app by copying a link and sending it to anyone. No coding, no deployment headaches.

There are also templates and ideas like:

*   Business profile apps
*   City builder mini-games
*   YouTube learning tools that turn videos into quizzes

### Advanced: Google AI Studio

For developers or technical users, [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) is the next level. It is still free to use to build and test apps, but you will need some technical skills to deploy them into production.

Inside AI Studio, you can:

*   Design agents and workflows
*   Wire them into external tools and APIs
*   Export code and plug it into your own stack

This combo of Opal for quick MVPs and AI Studio for deeper builds gives you a full path from idea to product.

## Master Research With Perplexity and NotebookLM

Research is one of the biggest time sinks in any online business. Whether you are planning a trip, learning a niche, or studying competitors, you can burn hours jumping between tabs.

A powerful combo here is Perplexity (through i10X) plus Google’s NotebookLM.

### Step 1: Deep Research With Perplexity Sonar Pro

Inside i10X, you can open Deep Research, which uses Perplexity’s Sonar Pro model.

Example query from the video:

> “I am planning a trip to Japan. What are the top things I should know so the trip goes smoothly, and what are the top resources to look at?”

You turn on web search, send the query, and Perplexity:

*   Searches the live web
*   Pulls in up-to-date sources
*   Organizes everything into a clear, report-style answer
*   Shows citations for each claim

You get a fast overview plus direct links to deeper resources, instead of scrolling through pages of search results yourself.

### Step 2: Organize and Use That Research in NotebookLM

Next, you move your best information into [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), Google’s free AI notebook tool.

Here is the process:

1.  Create a new notebook.
2.  Add sources:
    *   Paste text from Perplexity as “copied text”
    *   Add URLs from key articles
    *   Add YouTube videos
    *   Upload files or documents
3.  Once your sources are in the notebook, the AI knows only what those sources say.

Now you can:

*   Ask focused questions like “When is the best time to visit Japan?”
*   Ask it to build a day-by-day itinerary using only your trusted sources
*   Generate:
    *   A video overview
    *   An audio summary
    *   A written report based on the notebook

NotebookLM turns scattered research into a structured, searchable second brain for each topic you care about.

## Bonus Tools: Voice Cloning, Second Brain Notes, and Brainstorming

These last tools are less about direct selling, and more about making you faster and sharper as a creator or business owner.

### Voice Cloning With 11Labs

We already covered 11Labs for music, but its text-to-speech and voice cloning is where it first became popular.

You can:

1.  Record or upload samples of your voice.
2.  Let 11Labs train a voice clone.
3.  Type any script you want it to say.
4.  Generate a voiceover that sounds very close to you.

You can then tweak things like stability, style, and emotion to dial in the sound you want for YouTube videos, courses, or ads.

### Second Brain for Your Business With Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.com/) is a powerful note and workspace app that many people already use to track tasks, SOPs, and ideas. Now it has AI baked in.

Inside Notion, you can:

*   Store everything about your business in one place
*   Use AI to summarize notes, generate drafts, and clean up writing
*   Chat with pages or databases, powered by models like GPT, Claude, or Gemini

Think of it as a searchable brain for your business that you can actually talk to.

### Real-Time Brainstorming With ChatGPT Voice Mode

When you just need to think out loud with something smarter than a blank page, [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) with voice mode is a great option.

You can:

*   Open the app on desktop or iPhone
*   Tap the voice mode
*   Say something like, “I am trying to come up with an idea for a new YouTube video.”

ChatGPT responds in real time, asks follow-up questions, and feels more like a creative partner than a static tool. There are other AI tools with voice, but right now its voice quality and responsiveness are some of the best for brainstorming.

---

## Final Thoughts: Choose One Area and Start Experimenting

AI will not print money for you, but it can remove a lot of the friction that kept people stuck for years. You can now spin up a store, generate UGC-style videos, make custom music, build apps, research faster, and even clone your own voice, all with reasonable budgets.

Pick one area from this guide that fits you best, then test one tool in a real project. Maybe that is building an AI-powered store, launching short UGC videos for an affiliate product, or setting up NotebookLM as a research hub for your next niche.

Treat these tools as multipliers for the effort you already plan to put in, not as magic buttons, and they can become some of the strongest assets in your online business over the next few years.
