# 🧠 2.1 What is Machine Learning? (Fundamentals Explained for Beginners)

![What is Machine Learning](/images/learn/machine-learning/module-2/image-1.png)

Machine Learning (ML) is a core branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions with minimal human instruction.

To understand ML, first revisit the foundation from Module 1: 👉 **[What is AI?](/learn/ai-basics/module-1/1-1-what-is-ai)**

In that lesson, AI was defined as the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning is **how** machines gain that intelligence.

### 💬 Simple definition

Machine Learning is the science of teaching computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### In other words:

Instead of a programmer writing rules, ML systems **learn the rules themselves** by studying examples.

### Everyday examples of ML you already use:

-   **[Netflix](https://research.netflix.com/)** recommending movies
-   **[Google Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/)** predicting traffic
-   **[Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1366858)** identifying spam
-   **TikTok and YouTube** personalizing your feed
-   **Bank systems** detecting fraud
-   **AI in medical diagnosis**

ML works in the background, making your digital life smoother.

<MCQ
  question="What is the core difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?"
  options={["Traditional programming uses data to find rules, while ML uses rules to process data.", "Traditional programming requires explicit rules, while ML learns rules from data.", "There is no difference.", "ML is just faster traditional programming."]}
  correct="Traditional programming requires explicit rules, while ML learns rules from data."
  explanation="In traditional programming, humans write the rules. In Machine Learning, the system learns the rules (patterns) from data."
