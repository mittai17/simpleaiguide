# 📜 2.3 A Brief History of Machine Learning (From 1950s to Now)

![History of ML](/images/learn/machine-learning/module-2/image-3.png)

Machine Learning evolved over decades. Here’s the story in simple language:

## 1950s — The Birth of AI and ML Ideas

Alan Turing asks the fundamental question:
> **“Can machines think?”**

Foundational ideas of learning systems emerge.

## 1960s — Early Machine Learning Algorithms

The first ML algorithms appear:

-   **Nearest Neighbor**
-   **Perceptron** (first neural network idea)

Computers were too slow to train large models.

## 1980s — Rise of Decision Trees & Optimization

Algorithms like:

-   **ID3**
-   **Decision Trees**
-   **Backpropagation** (key for neural networks)

These change the field forever.

## 1990s — Data Boom, Better Models

As data grew, ML became practical. Developments included:

-   **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
-   **Ensemble methods**

## 2012 — Deep Learning Revolution

A neural network (**AlexNet**) beats traditional ML at image recognition. This is the turning point.

## 2017–Present — Transformers & Modern AI

Google introduces the **Transformer** architecture, leading to:

-   **GPT models**
-   **ChatGPT**
-   **Claude**
-   **Gemini**
-   **LLaMA**

Transformers redefine ML and NLP forever.
