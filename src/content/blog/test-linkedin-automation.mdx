## LinkedIn Automation Test

This is a generated test post.

We have just configured a GitHub Action to automatically detect new blog posts and share them to LinkedIn via the official API.

### How it works:
1. A new `.mdx` file is pushed to `src/content/blog/`.
2. GitHub Actions triggers the `autopost-linkedin.yml` workflow.
3. The workflow identifies the new file.
4. It extracts the `title` and `description` from the frontmatter.
5. It uses the `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret to authenticate with LinkedIn.
6. It posts the article update to the user's profile.

If this works, we are fully automated! 🎉
