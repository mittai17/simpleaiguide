# 🧬 2.6 Types of Machine Learning (Complete Detailed Section)

ML has four major types. Each type solves different problems.

## ⭐ Type 1 — Supervised Learning (Most Important in ML)

**[Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)** uses **labeled data**.

**Example:**

| Image | Label |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cat photo | Cat |
| Dog photo | Dog |

### Used for:

-   Email spam detection
-   Disease prediction
-   Face recognition
-   Credit card fraud detection

### Why it’s powerful:

It learns the relationship between `input → output`.

## ⭐ Type 2 — Unsupervised Learning

Learns from **[unlabeled data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)**. Finds hidden patterns.

### Examples:

-   Customer segmentation
-   Product grouping
-   Document clustering

### Algorithms:

-   K-Means
-   Hierarchical Clustering
-   PCA

## ⭐ Type 3 — Semi-Supervised Learning

Mix of:

-   Few labeled samples
-   Many unlabeled samples

**Used in:**

-   YouTube video tagging
-   Facial recognition
-   Speech labeling

## ⭐ Type 4 — Reinforcement Learning (Learning by Reward)

Agent takes actions → gets **[reward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)** → learns.

**Used in:**

-   Self-driving cars
-   Robotics
-   Game AI
-   Navigation
