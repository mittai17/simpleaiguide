Stop Wasting Money: I Tested 6 “All-in-One” AI Tools – These Are the Only Ones Worth Using in 2025

If you’re still paying for a single AI video tool like Kling, Runway, Veo 3.1, or even Sora, you’re probably:

Overpaying

Missing key features (lip sync, upscaling, voice, music)

Limiting your creative options

The reality in 2025: The best creators aren’t using one model. They’re using all-in-one AI platforms that bundle:

Image generation

Video generation

Lip sync

Voice

Music

Upscaling

…under one roof.

So I compared 6 of the biggest all-in-one AI platforms:

Freepik AI

Artlist AI

OpenArt

Adobe Firefly

Hixfield AI

Weevi (Weev.ai)

I scored them across 4 real-world categories:

Power – how many models, and which ones?

Innovation – what unique features stand out?

Experience – how smooth and intuitive is the platform?

Value – how much does each generation actually cost in dollars?

By the end, you’ll know which platform fits you best: beginner, creator, or power user.

⚠️ Note: This is not sponsored. I’ve worked with or used most of these platforms, but rankings are based on features, models, usability, and price—not partnerships.

📌 The Short Answer (If You’re in a Hurry)

If you don’t want the long breakdown:

Best “sweet spot” for creators: 👉 OpenArt or Hixfield

Best for advanced workflows / power users: 👉 Weevi

Great but pricey / situational: 👉 Freepik AI

Only worth it if you’re already in their ecosystem: 👉 Adobe Firefly and Artlist

Now let’s go deep.

1️⃣ Power: Which Tool Has the Strongest Models?

“Power” isn’t just about how many models a platform supports. It’s about having the right ones:

Top-tier image models (Flux, Nano Banana, Cream, etc.)

Serious video models (Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Kling, Runway, etc.)

Lip sync, upscalers, voice models, and custom training

🅰 Freepik AI – Strong, Well-Rounded Model Set

🅲 Adobe Firefly – Strong Ecosystem, Weak Model Variety

Adobe Firefly is great inside the Adobe ecosystem, but weaker in terms of model variety.

Image models:

Firefly Image 4

Runway Gen-4 image

Some proprietary or safer models for enterprise (but missing popular Chinese models like Nano Banana & Cream)

Video models:

Firefly Video

Pika

Ray 3 / Ray 3 HDR

Veo

(But missing: Sora 2, Kling, 1.2.5, Cense, etc.)

👉 Verdict: Decent models, but no Chinese models and missing popular low-cost workhorses like Kling and 1.2.5.

Power Tier: C

🅰 Hixfield AI – Focused on the Models That Actually Matter

Hixfield doesn’t overwhelm you with hundreds of models; it focuses on the most useful ones.

Image models:

2️⃣ Innovation: Who’s Actually Doing Something New?

Next, I looked at unique features—not just “we also have an image generator.”

Freepik – Spaces (A Weevi-Style Lite Workflow Builder)

Freepik has tons of tools, but truly unique features are limited.

The standout:

Spaces: a visual workflow builder where you connect prompts → models → upscalers → video. It’s like a simplified Weevi, with some camera controls and basic chaining.

Other nice-but-common features:

Assistant for generating new poses

Built-in video editor

Project timelines

👉 Innovation Tier: B

Artlist – AI + Asset Library in One Subscription

Artlist’s edge is not AI features alone. It’s the fact you get:

AI generation (image, video, voice)

PLUS music, stock footage, sound effects, templates — under one roof.

If you’re already using Artlist for music/footage, the AI add-ons are convenient.

But pure AI innovation? The tools themselves are still basic.

👉 Innovation Tier: C

OpenArt – Story Builder, Motion Sync & Deep Controls

OpenArt brings some genuinely cool features:

Story builder: Generate full music videos, character vlogs, explainer videos, ASMR stories with scripts + scenes + timelines.

Storyboard / editor view: Built-in editor where you can assemble scenes, regenerate, and tweak without another NLE.

Advanced control for images: Face reference, pose editor, pose ref, custom models, detailed controls.

Motion Sync with Runway Act 2: Very few platforms support this properly.

👉 Innovation Tier: A

Adobe Firefly – Deep Ecosystem Integration & Boards

Adobe’s strength is integration, not raw AI power.

Key innovation:

Boards: a visual canvas where you can organize generations, iterate on styles, and ideate visually.

One-click “Open in Photoshop / Illustrator / After Effects” from Firefly.

Very smooth for users already deep into Creative Cloud.

The catch:

You pretty much only feel the magic if you’re already an Adobe user.

👉 Innovation Tier: A

Hixfield – Templates & Popcorn for Beginners

Hixfield shines in one specific way:

Templates, templates, templates. Tons of ready-made VFX, trends, transitions, zoom-outs, Wonderland-style visuals, etc.

Popcorn feature: A storyboard-like tool where you upload up to 4 images and it auto-plans scenes.

Draw-to-video: Turn rough sketches into videos or final images.

For beginners who don’t know prompts yet, this is massive.

👉 Innovation Tier: S

Weevi – Node-Based AI Workflows for Creators & Builders

Weevi is innovation on another level:

Node-based workflow builder (like Figma for AI pipelines)

Combine images, prompts, reference styles, control images, 3D compositors, and video models in one flow

Real-time compositing for 3D/2D setups (e.g., numachia boat example)

Shareable boards: copy someone else’s workflow and plug in your own assets

Perfect for building products, repeatable pipelines, and advanced experiments

3️⃣ Experience: Which Platform Is Actually Nice to Use?

Raw power doesn’t matter if using the tool feels like a headache.

Here’s how the UX / usability compares.

Freepik – Polished, But Slightly Confusing Navigation

Pros:

Clean design

Strong filtering & views (grid, size, color, type)

Easy to upscale, reuse, and organize images into folders

Good tutorials & community inspiration

Cons:

Home, AI Suite, and All Tools don’t feel unified

Model selector in image vs video view is inconsistent

Search bar mostly finds stock assets, not tools

👉 Experience Tier: A

Artlist – Simple, But Too Basic & Slightly Confusing

Pros:

Very straightforward generation

Few distractions

Easy “generate → transform → animate” flow

Cons:

Image & video in the same tab toggle feels clunky

No clear model visual previews or guidance

Tool feels early-stage and barebones

👉 Experience Tier: C

OpenArt – Great Balance for Beginners & Power Users

Pros:

Clear left sidebar for Image / Video / Character / Audio / Story

Easy switching between text-to-video, image-to-video, lip sync, upscale

Strong reuse flow: generate → upscale → animate → edit

Good control panels and references

Cons:

“My images” and “my videos” can appear in mixed views

Filtering of past generations could be better (e.g., filter by model)

👉 Experience Tier: S

Adobe Firefly – Powerful Boards, But Learning Curve

Pros:

Boards are great for iterative ideation

Tight integration with Photoshop/Illustrator/After Effects

Ideal for designers who already use Adobe products

Cons:

Firefly by itself can feel slow and limited

Many features still in beta/waitlist

Some video features (like start+end frame for Veo 3.1) feel incomplete

Requires understanding of the Adobe ecosystem

👉 Experience Tier: B

Hixfield – Friendly, Template-Heavy, Slightly Overcrowded

Pros:

Perfect for beginners

Huge library of templates/effects for video

Easy to switch models, choose quality, and tweak parameters

Clear image/video/editor separation

Cons:

Hard to find older assets (past generations) quickly

Video history / asset search could be better

👉 Experience Tier: A (almost S with better asset management)

Weevi – Powerful but Overwhelming for New Users

Pros:

Insanely flexible

Ideal for people building serious AI workflows

Live updates, advanced control, sharable boards

Cons:

Steep learning curve

Feels slow or heavy at times

Requires learning keybinds & navigation patterns

4️⃣ Value: What Does Each Generation Actually Cost?

Forget credits and vague sliders. What matters is:

💸 “How much do I pay per video or image in real money?”

To compare fairly, we look at:

Sora 2 (Pro), 8s video

Veo 3.1, 8s, highest quality

Kling 2.5, 10s video

(Prices shift over time, but the relative ranking is what matters most.)

Key Notes:

Plans compared: realistic monthly creator plans (not $200+ enterprise tiers)

Annual plans usually bring 20–50% discounts

Some platforms run promos (Hixfield often has crazy discounts)

💰 High-Level Ranking (Monthly)

From most expensive per generation → cheapest overall:

Adobe Firefly – most expensive + missing key models

Freepik – especially pricey for Sora 2 Pro

Artlist – cheaper than Freepik, but still not the best deal

Weevi – good pricing, especially for Kling & Veo 3.1

Hixfield – excellent promo pricing, strong per-gen cost

OpenArt – overall best balance of cost across Sora, Veo, and Kling

⚠️ Exact numbers change over time, but OpenArt and Hixfield consistently come out cheaper for serious use, especially on yearly plans or promos.

🧠 So… Which All-in-One AI Tool Should You Use?

Let’s simplify everything.

🟢 If You’re a Beginner / Content Creator

You want:

Easy templates

Good models

No crazy learning curve

Best picks:

Hixfield – most beginner-friendly (templates, VFX, prebuilt effects)

OpenArt – next-level once you understand prompts

🟡 If You’re a Serious Creator / Power User

You want:

Access to many models

Good pricing

Usable interface

Lip sync, voice, upscaling, advanced tools

Best picks:

OpenArt – best balance of power + price + UX

Hixfield – strong second, especially with promotions

Freepik – great if you’re already using Freepik for assets and design

🔴 If You’re a Builder / Workflow Nerd / Automation Lover

You want:

Node-based workflows

Custom model imports

Full control over pipelines

Best pick:

Weevi – nothing else comes close today

You can also pair Weevi with:

OpenArt (for everyday stuff)

Hixfield (for fast templated content)

⚪ If You’re Deep in Adobe or Artlist Already

If you already pay for:

Adobe Creative Cloud → use Firefly for convenience, but don’t rely on it for cutting-edge models.

Artlist Max → use Artlist AI for basic image/video if you’re there for music & footage anyway.

You don’t have to switch, but if AI becomes your main workflow, you’ll probably want at least one of:

OpenArt

Hixfield

Weevi
