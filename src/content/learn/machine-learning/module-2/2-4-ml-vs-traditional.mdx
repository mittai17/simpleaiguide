# 🎯 2.4 Machine Learning vs Traditional Programming (Clear Comparison)

![Comparison diagram showing Traditional Programming (Rules + Data = Answers) versus Machine Learning (Data + Answers = Rules)](/images/learn/machine-learning/module-2/image-4.png)

### Traditional Programming:

-   Human writes rules
-   Computer follows them
-   Cannot adapt
-   Fails when data is messy

### Machine Learning:

-   Machine learns rules from examples
-   Automatically improves
-   Adapts to new data
-   Handles complexity better

### Simplified:

-   **Traditional:** `IF condition A THEN do B`
-   **Machine Learning:** Learn `A → B` pattern from data

This is why ML is used today for complex tasks like:

-   Vision
-   Speech
-   Translation
-   Predictions

<MCQ
  question="In the context of Machine Learning vs. Traditional Programming, what is the output of the ML process?"
  options={["Data", "Rules (Patterns)", "Hardware", "Electricity"]}
  correct="Rules (Patterns)"
  explanation="Machine Learning takes Data and Answers (Output) to learn the Rules (Patterns), whereas traditional programming takes Data and Rules to produce Answers."
