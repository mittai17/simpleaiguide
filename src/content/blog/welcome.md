# Welcome!

We have successfully migrated our blog to a **Git-based CMS**. This means:

1.  **Faster Performance**: Content is pre-built and served as static HTML.
2.  **Better Security**: No database or login page to hack.
3.  **Easy Updates**: We just push a markdown file to GitHub!

## What's Next?
