# 🧠 2.1 What is Machine Learning? (Fundamentals Explained for Beginners)

![What is Machine Learning](/images/learn/machine-learning/module-2/image-1.png)

Machine Learning (ML) is a core branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions with minimal human instruction.

To understand ML, first revisit the foundation from Module 1: 👉 **[What is AI?](/learn/ai-basics/module-1/1-1-what-is-ai)**

In that lesson, AI was defined as the ability of machines to mimic human intelligence. Machine Learning is **how** machines gain that intelligence.

### 💬 Simple definition

Machine Learning is the science of teaching computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### In other words:

Instead of a programmer writing rules, ML systems **learn the rules themselves** by studying examples.

### Everyday examples of ML you already use:

-   **Netflix** recommending movies
-   **Google Maps** predicting traffic
-   **Gmail** identifying spam
-   **TikTok and YouTube** personalizing your feed
-   **Bank systems** detecting fraud
-   **AI in medical diagnosis**

ML works in the background, making your digital life smoother.
